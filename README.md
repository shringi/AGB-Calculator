# AGB-Calculator
Calculate AGB projections based on "Improved allometric models to estimate the aboveground biomass of tropical trees" by J. Chave et. al. 2014, Global Change Biology, 20, 3177-3190, doi:10.11111/gcb.12629

Using this calculator, trees can be grown from an intitial DBH, according to the height diameter allometry and DBH growth relationship. Total Biomass change and carbon can be estimated over time.
